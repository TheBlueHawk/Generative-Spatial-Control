I need to map different objects in a description of an image to a NxN grid. Each cell of the grid can be assigned to an object or Empty.
I will give you the image description and you should respond with
(1) first a JSON object containing an array representation of the NxN grid and your reasoning.
(2) second a text representation of the NxN grid.

Example Input 1:
```
 Description: "A cat on the left and a dog on the right"
 N=4
```

Example Output 1:
```
{{
“reasoning_objects”: “There is a Cat and there is a Dog”,
“reasoning_horizontal”: “From left to right, we have the Cat and then the Dog.”,
"grid_text": "| Empty | Empty | Dog | Dog |\n| Cat | Cat | Dog | Dog |\n| Cat | Cat | Dog | Dog |\n| Cat | Cat | Dog | Dog |"
"grid": [["cat", "cat", "dog", "dog"], ["cat", "cat", "dog", "dog"], ["cat", "cat", "dog", "dog"], ["cat", "cat", "dog", "dog"]],
"prompt": "A cat on the left and a dog on the right",
"N": 4
}}

| Empty | Empty | Dog | Dog |
| Cat | Cat | Dog | Dog |
| Cat | Cat | Dog | Dog |
| Cat | Cat | Dog | Dog |
```

Example Input 2:
```
Description: ”A cat on top of a book on top of a large table”
N=5
```

Example Output 2:
```
{{
“reasoning_objects”: “There is a Cat, a Book, and a Table”,
“reasoning_horizontal”: “From top to bottom, we have the Cat, the Book, and the Table.”,
"grid_text": "| Cat | Cat | Empty | Empty| Empty |\n| Cat | Cat | Empty | Empty | Empty |\n| Book | Book | Empty | Empty | Empty |\n| Table | Table | Table | Table | Table |\n| Table | Table | Table | Table | Table |"
"grid": [["cat", "cat", "empty", "empty", “empty”], ["cat", "cat", "empty", "empty", “empty”], ["book", "book", “empty”, "empty", "empty"], [“table", "table", "table", "table", “table”], [“table", "table", "table", "table", “table”]],
"prompt": "A cat on top of a book on top of a large table",
"N": 5
}}

```

The following examples will show the grid visualization for brevity, but for your responses, please remember include the JSON output.

Example Input 3: "4 cats in each corner starting at the dog in the middle"
Output:
| Cat | Empty | Empty | Cat |
| Empty | Dog | Dog | Empty |
| Empty | Dog | Dog | Empty |
| Cat | Empty | Empty | Cat |


Example Input 4: "A flock of birds flying above the mountains, a river in the foreground"
Output:
| Birds | Birds | Birds | Birds |
| Mountains | Mountains | Mountains | Mountains |
| River | River | River | River |
| Empty | Empty | Empty | Empty |



Example Input 5: "A single bird  flying above the mountains, a river in the foreground"
Output:
| Bird | Mountains | Mountains | Empty |
| Empty | Mountains | Mountains | Empty |
| River | River | River | River |
| Empty | Empty | Empty | Empty |


Example Input 6: "Two birds  flying above the mountains, a river in the foreground"
Output: | Bird | Bird | Mountains | Mountains |
| Empty | Empty | Mountains | Mountains |
| River | River | River | River |
| Empty | Empty | Empty | Empty |


Example Input 7: "Three birds  flying above the mountains, a river in the foreground"
Output: | Bird | Bird | Bird | Mountains |
| Empty | Empty | Empty | Mountains |
| River | River | River | River |
| Empty | Empty | Empty | Empty |


Example Input 8: "Five birds flying above the mountains, a river in the foreground"
Output: | Bird | Bird | Bird | Bird |
| Bird | Mountains | Mountains | Mountains |
| Empty | River | River | River |
